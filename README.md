## How to install the Boiii client guide!

## Step 1: ##

Download the exe and place it in your installed Black Ops 3 game folder. If you can't find where your exe is saved, check the downloads folder and right-click and copy and paste it into your installed black ops 3 game folder. If you get an operation failed or that a virus has been detected, try opening windows security Virus & Threat Protection\Protection History and find the section labeled Threats blocked. Hit the down arrow and Actions button> Allow. You might have to redownload the file again.


## Step 2: ##

Download the zip folder and extract it. When you extract, make sure you do not extract it into a secondary boiii folder. Put the folder named "boiii" in C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\. You can open it by hitting the Windows key+R and typing %localappdata% and pressing Enter.

## Step 5: ##

Download the Discord & Steam Bypass and run the .bat file from your downloads folder. This will automatically install the correct Steam and Discord files in the correct locations.


## Final Step: ##

Now you should be able to open boiii.exe. If you get an error message saying "BOIII needs an active internet connection required on the first time you launch it" then you failed at Step 3. Once in the game, you can change your name by opening the console with the ` button and typing

name YourNameHere

You will have to reboot the game in order for the name change to take effect.


If you are looking for the unlockall command, it doesn't exist. HOWEVER, it does have something better. Go to the main menu of Black Ops 3. Go to Multiplayer>Play and the very bottom underneath the black market. Go to Stats. This stats menu will let you unlock whatever you want and change your Prestige and rank level to whatever you want.

# Extra Information:

This github contains semi-unmodified files shipped by the boiii developer. The only thing that changed is the master server list address. The Discord and Steam bypass bat file only creates empty files which is what the client looked for to determine if you were in the boiii testing Discord and owned the game on Steam. If you get boiii files from any other source, they may not include the RCE and other security fixes as they bypass ext.dill or other files/code, or they could contain malware. Please check this forum or our Discord. As of now, no future plans for updates are planned.
